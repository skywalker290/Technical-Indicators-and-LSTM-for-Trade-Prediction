# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Financial Indicator Development, and Price Estimation for NSE Nifty 50 Stock Market Data Using Machine Learning

As a part of our minor project required for the fifth semester, we are using minute-to-minute varied data from the Nifty 50 and developing seven technical indicators, namely:
 
1. Simple Moving Average
2. Volume Moving Average
3. Exponential Moving Average
4. Relative State Indexing
5. Moving Average Convergence Divergence
6. Upper and Lower Bollinger Bands
7. Average True Range

With the help of these, we are further estimating the exit price, the stop loss, and hence the risk-to-reward ratio for the particular stock data analyzed using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks, which will guide the user whether to short buy, long buy, or square-off their dealings.
